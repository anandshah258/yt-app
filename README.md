# yt-app

This is a **YouTube** based browser application that makes use of the **YoutTube Data API**. At the very top, in a searchbar, a user can enter a search term, for example, *'react js'* and press enter. It will trigger a search request over to the **API**. With the API's help, a search is made to fetch a list of videos mathing the search term. After the list of videos is fetched from the API, they will be shown to the user on the right hand side of the screen. A user can click on one of these videos and it will be featured in the centre. Then a user can click on the play button and stream the video. A title and a description of the video will be displayed at the bottom as well.

The App is created with ***create-react-app*** and is deployed with ***Netlify***. Click on the following link to try it. **[yt-app](https://unruffled-sinoussi-46abd1.netlify.app/)**
